# Tech-Stopper--Medieval
This series of mods cuts short the tech tree until the *Medieval Era*

This mod abides by vanilla gameplay, but it has slight changes to normal vanilla, which are:

- Caravel and Astronomy effects are obtained in Compass
- Banking tech is in the Medieval era now for historical autenticity.
